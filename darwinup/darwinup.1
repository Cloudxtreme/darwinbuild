.Os Darwin
.Sh NAME
.Nm darwinup
.Nd Install, uninstall, and manage roots
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfnv
.Op Fl p Ar path
.Ar subcommand 
.Op Ar arguments ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
allows you to manage roots, or
archives, of files that replace parts of your system. This is useful
for installing a new version of a library or tool on your system while 
allowing you to uninstall the files and revert back to the originals 
safely and easily.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It \-d
Do not update dyld cache. Darwinup normally runs update_dyld_shared_cache 
if the operation actually changes files on disk. To ensure this does not 
happen, you can provide this option.
.It \-f
Force. Some operations will fail gracefully due to potentially unsafe 
situations, such as a root that installs a file where a directory is.
In order to have darwinup continue through such a situation, you can
pass the -f option.
.It \-n
Dry run. Darwinup will go through an operation, including analyzing
the root(s) and printing the state/change symbol, but no files will
be modified on your system and no records will be added to the depot.
.It \-p Op Ar path
Prefix path. Normally, darwinup will operate on the boot partition. You
can use the -p option to have darwinup work on another partition. You
can provide any arbitrary path, it does not need to be a mount point.
.It \-v
Verbose. This option causes darwinup to print extra information. You can
pass 2 or 3 v's for even more information, but that is usually only needed
for development and debugging of darwinup itself.
.El
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
Note that the
.Ar path
and
.Ar archive
options listed below support globbing and multiple items. See the EXAMPLES 
section below for more details.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Ar files Ar archives
List the files and directories in the 
.Ar archive .
.It Ar install Ar path
Install the root at 
.Ar path .
.It Ar list Op Ar archive
List archives that are installed. You may optionally provide an
archive specification to limit which archives get listed. 
.It Ar uninstall Ar archives
Uninstall the specified archive.
.It Ar upgrade Ar path
Find the last archive that was installed with the same name (basename of 
path), and replace it with the root at 
.Ar path .
.It Ar verify Ar archive
List all of the information about 
.Ar archive .
This includes status letters
detailing how the archive differs from whats on disk
.El
.Sh STATE/CHANGE SYMBOLS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It ? 
Unknown state. Probably a bug.
.It !
Missing file during uninstall. Darwinup expected a file or directory to 
exist, but it did not. This could be a bug in darwinup, but most likely 
another tool or software update removed a file that darwinup had been 
tracking. It can also be caused by an installation failing due to an
object changing type (see FORCING OPERATIONS below), and the subsequent 
rollback finding the root only partially installed. Since these all 
happen during uninstall, they are typically safe to ignore, since darwinup 
was going to delete the object anyway.
.It A
Added. No previous file or directory existed so the file or directory was
added to your system.
.It E
External change. The file you are installing is different than the 
last file you installed, but it is identical to what was actually found
on disk. This probably means something manually installed a root or software
update without darwinup knowing about it. This is usually harmless. 
.It M 
Mode change. Only changes to permission or ownership were needed to
uninstall the file or directory. 
.It R
Removed. No previous file or directory existed, so the uninstall process
removed the file. 
.It U
Updated. During installation, the file or directory replaces an existing 
object at the same path. During uninstallation, the previous version of
the file was restored.
